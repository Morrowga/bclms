## Our DDD folder structure
![Alt text](images/rootfolderstructure.png)
  This is the root folder structure of our project that contains the `BlendedConcept` , `Common` and `Auth` as root domain.

  <span> **BlendedConcept** contains all the module and feature that we implement we might need to write inside by create `Domain` name according to each module </span>

  <span> **Auth** contains the basic `login` and `register` that we have implement inside that domain. </span>


  <span> **Common** are the root folder structure setup of laravel that we have implement inside it.
  </span>

  As a example <br/>
  You have `RouteServiceProvider` , `AppServiceProvider` inside  `Common` folder here we might need to link their `routes` and `ServiceProvider` from other Domains to these Domain
<ul> 
</ul>
